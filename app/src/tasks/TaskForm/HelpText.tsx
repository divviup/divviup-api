        result (sum of measurements). Regardless of this choice, the aggregate

        <p>
          Groups measurements into batches by their client timestamp. Collectors
          may query for aggregate results over (non-overlapping) time intervals.
          Good for identifying temporal patterns in data. If client reports may
          be received late, well after their timestamps, then the collector is
          forced to choose between delaying collection requests or abandoning
          late reports.
        </p>
        <h5>Fixed Size:</h5>
        <p>
          Groups measurements into batches arbitrarily as they arrive. Grants
          more control over batch sizes, because a maximum batch size can be
          set. Good for cases where the report upload rate is unknown or varies
          widely. Temporal patterns in data may be obscured by aggregating
          on-time and late reports together in the same batches.
